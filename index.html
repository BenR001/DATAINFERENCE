    <h1 id="D_title">Heart Disease Prediction Dataset</h1>
    <h2 id="desc">DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>My dataset was taken from the University of California Irvine data repository, it is used to predict heart disease.</p>
    <h2 id="desc">DETAILS</h2>
    <p>Patients were classified as having or not having heart disease based on cardiac catheterization, the gold standard. <br>
        If they had more than 50% narrowing of a coronary artery they were labeled as having heart disease.<br>
        There are 270 patients and there are 13 independent predictive variables or column attributes. <br>
        The attributes are explained <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease'>here</a> and shown below. <br>
        </p>
        <p>1. #3 (age)<br>
            2. #4 (sex)<br>
            3. #9 (cp)<br>
            4. #10 (trestbps)<br>
            5. #12 (chol)<br>
            6. #16 (fbs)<br>
            7. #19 (restecg)<br>
            8. #32 (thalach)<br>
            9. #38 (exang)<br>
            10. #40 (oldpeak)<br>
            11. #41 (slope)<br>
            12. #44 (ca)<br>
            13. #51 (thal)<br>
            14. #58 (num) (the predicted attribute) </p>
    <h2 id="desc">Prelimitary Analysis</h2>
    <h4 id="desc">Histograms:</h4>
    <img src="Ages.png" alt="Ages graph"> 
    <p>The first histogram is describing the frequency of ages between each patient. We can observe that <br>most of the patients
    are between the ages of 50 and 60. We can also observe a normal distribution. </p>
    <img src="Sexes.png" alt="Sexes graph">
    <p>This barplot describes The frequency of Sexes between the patients. 0 indicates women and 1 for men. <br>
    We observe that there is much more men in the data than women.</p>
    <img src="Blood.png" alt="Blood graph">
    <p>This histogram describes the frequency of systolic bloodpressures between the patients. We can observe<br>the typical
    bloodpressure is between 110 and 140. We can also suprisingly see patients with bloodpressures that would be considered <br>
    to be in a hypertensive crisis which would call for an emergency room visit. We would consider this an outlier.</p>
    <img src="Chest.png" alt="Chest graph">
    <p>This graph describes the frequency of types of chest pain felt by the patients. 1 is typical angina, 2 <br> is
    atypical angina, 3 is non-anginal pain, and 4 is asymptomatic. While most of the patients were asymptomatic, the 2nd most <br>
    frequent was non-anginal pain which is associated with pain in the chest that is not related to the heart.</p>
    <h2 id="desc">Milestone 6</h2>
    <h4 id="desc">Values:</h4>
    <img src="m6_values.png" alt="m6 values">
    <p>1. The mean and median values are different. The mean values for Age (mean_value) represents the average Age
        of the individuals. <br>This suggests that the individuals are, on average,relatively old. As for the blood pressure mean (mean_value2)
        this suggests that <br>the individuals have relatively high blood pressure. The median values are different, however this is not
        <br> suprising as it was not expected to be similar due to taking two different measures.<br><br>
        2. As for the standard deviation (SD), The SD of the ages is lower than the blood pressure column. This<br>
        means that the values are likely to be more spread out in the blood pressure column than the ages column.<br>
        In other words, the values in ages are more clustered together around the mean than in bloodpressure.
    </p>
    <h2 id="desc">Milestone 7</h2>
    <img src="m7_plot.png" alt="m7 graph">
    <h4 id="desc">Values:</h4>
    <img src="m7_values.png" alt="m7 values">
    <p> 
        The two columns(age and blood pressure) have a weak positive linear relationship. <br>
        The direction of the scatterplot seems to move from the bottom left twoards the top right. <br>
        The data points are scattered around, also confirming the weak relationship. <br>
        There are also outliers that can be seen on both ends. I do not believe them to be errors, <br>
        but important considerations when interpreting the data.
